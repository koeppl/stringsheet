String Sheet â™«
==============

A collection of (at least for me) most frequent equations you likely come across when studying stringology.
The sheet covers common text data structures, succinct tree representations, regularities like periodicities or Lyndon words.
The aim of the sheet is to be precise, accurate, and brief. 
Any suggestions for updates are welcome.

For your convenience, there is a [compiled PDF version](http://dkppl.de/static/bin/paper/stringsheet.pdf) available.
