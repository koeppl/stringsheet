String Sheet â™«
==============

A collection of (at least for me) most frequent equations you come across when studying stringology, covering common text data structures, succinct tree representations, regularities like periodicities or Lyndon words.
The aim of the sheet is be precise, accurate, and brief. 
Any suggestions for updates are welcome.
